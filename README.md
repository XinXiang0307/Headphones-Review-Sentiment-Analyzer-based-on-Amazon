## Project Topics

This project introduces a sophisticated Product Review Sentiment Analyzer, a novel tool designed to recalibrate product ratings by meticulously examining the emotional undertones present in review texts. Central to our innovation is the ability to significantly mitigate the impact of spurious reviews, thereby ensuring a more authentic and equitable assessment of product ratings. Moreover, this analyzer goes a step further by distilling and highlighting the essence of negative feedback through a strategic analysis of critical keywords. This feature is predicated on the understanding that consumers, when evaluating competing products, tend to place a greater emphasis on identifying potential shortcomings rather than advantages. Our overarching aim is to furnish users with a streamlined and inherently fair evaluation of product reviews, obviating the need for them to painstakingly sift through voluminous feedback. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to empower consumers with intuitive and balanced insights, facilitating a more informed purchasing decision without the encumbrance of navigating an overwhelming array of reviews.
